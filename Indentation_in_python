# Indentation 

def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("World")

my_function()

# this is a full manifestation of indentation(space like pararagh)
# if one of the instruction isn't indented,it won't be included when the function is defined
# e.g
# def my_function():
#     print("Hello")
# print("World")

# my_function()

# indetattion blocks(if,function,elif block)
# def my_function():
#     if sky =="clear":
#         print("blue")

#     elif sky =="cloudy":
#         print("grey")
#     print("Hello")
# print("World")


# While loops
# While Loops runs as long loops as long as the condition is true

# Difference btw for loops and while loops
# for loops:exist in two forms
# 1. for items in list_of_items:
#     Do something to each item

# 2. for number in range(a,b):
#     print(number)

# for loops are great when u want to iterate over something and you need to do something with each things u are iterating

# While loops
# while something_is_true
    # Do something repeatedly
# until the condition is False,the loop will keep running

# now how to use while loop to solve our previous hurdles char instead of for loops
