# functions,code blocks and while loops

# Functions
# Types of in-built function() of python
# input(),float(),len(),print(),range(),sum(),str() etc 
# for example,let us one of the funtions print()
# print("Hello")
# num_char =len("Hello")
# print(num_char)

# What if we want to make our own function...
# ~we use def keyword(creating and defining our function)
# ~give our function a name(my_function)
# eg

# def my_function():
#     print("Hello")
#     print("Bye")

# my_function()

# a simple illustration on how function works

# def my_function():
#     do this
#     then do this
#     Finally do this

# To call a function like to excute the code

# def my_function():
#     do this
#     then do this
#     Finally do this

# my_function()

# in the game of the rekgok robot,i got 

# move()
# move()
# turn_left()
# turn_left()
# move()
# move()
# turn_left()
# turn_left()

# for the the robot to move around in a circle form 

# but wat if they was another function that replace that double turn_left to turn_around since that double turn_left means for the robort to turn around
# e.g now turn_around is introduced here to replace the double turn_left

# def turn_around():
#     turn_left()
#     turn_left()

# move()
# move()
# turn_around()
# move()
# move()
# turn_around()

# it will do the same thing this will give : but with turn around  which exist the game before but with the help of def 

# move()
# move()
# turn_left()
# turn_left()
# move()
# move()
# turn_left()
# turn_left()
